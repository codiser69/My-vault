## ---<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Introduction/why we need</mark> ---
- the number of species that are known and described range between 1.7 to 1.8 million.
- more than 30 million species inhibited the bio-sphere. Ranging from microscopic bacteria to blue whale. 
- These Organisms differ in form, structure and mode of living, this need to be grouped and grouping of related organisms helps to study evolutionary relationships and to identify them.
- all are interconnected, as shown in FOOD CHAIN   ![[Pasted image 20241109105120.png]]
## ---<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"><u>History of Classification</u></mark>---
⬥ in the   **4th century - Aristotle** ( the Greek philosopher ) initially classified 
   animals based on their habitat (land, water, air), but this method was unscientific
⬥ <u>Evolution</u> :-  [[2. universe &  Evolution !!!!#---EVOLUTION---|explanation]]

### ---<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"> Classification System</mark>---
⬥<u> Ernst Haskell, Robert Whittaker, Carl Woese</u> classified these in KINGDOM. which has 5 sub-category 1. Monera, 2. Protista 3. Fungi 4. plantae 5. Animalia.
This was not a sudden development, below bullet-point indicates how it's made 👇
> - <u>**Carolus Linnaeus</u>(1758)** classified all organisms as  plantae and Animalia only for the first time in his book '*Systema Naturae*' . 
>   This system did not distinguish between the eukaryotes and prokaryotes, unicellular and multicellular and photosynthetic organisms.
> - <u>**Ernst**(1886</u>) suggested to add protista (Eukaryotic unicellular organisms). 
> - <u>**Copeland**</u> introduced Monera( all prokaryotic organisms).
> - <u>**Whittekar** (1969</u>) intoduced mycota (fungaiee).

and that's how WHITTEKAR got the title of 5 KINGDOM CLASSIFICATION. Also known as Modern Classification.
⬥ This classification is based on cell structure, mde of nutrition, and body organizations.

#### TAXONOMIC CATEGORIES ([[Taxonomie Hierarchy]]) :- based on [[4. CELL STRUCTURE ➡ Cytology|cell struture]]
 
⬥ <u>Kingdom</u> can be further classified into <u>phylum (for animals) or division (for 
   plants)</u>, and down to <u>class,</u> <u>order</u>, <u>family</u>, <u>genus</u>, and <u>species</u>, with species being the basic unit of classifications.👇👇

## ---<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Binomial Nomenclature</mark>---
- <u>Carolus Linnaeus</u> is called the father of modern taxonomy
- it is Introduced by him, binomial nomenclature involves naming organisms with a "genus or genera or Taxon" name followed by a "species" name, both in Latins i.e. *'<u>Homo</u> + <u>sapiens</u>'*. & *'<u>Pavo</u> + <u>cristatus</u>'*
- the conventions of naming include 'capitalizing' the genus name, 'using lowercase' for the species name, and 'italicizing or underlining' the names. Name can't be less than 3 or more than 20 letters.

- ### ==*Specific Naming Conventions:-==*
- The trinomial system includes a third word for subspecies differentiation, though it is less commonly used.
- When the genus and species names are the same, the term "toponyms" applies in naming animals, while such names (termed "patronyms") are not accepted for plants.

## ---<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Characteristics of the Kingdoms</mark>---

- **[[details OF specific SECTION|MONERA]]**: Includes prokaryotic organisms like bacteria; can be autotrophic or heterotrophics.
- **Protista**: Comprises unicellular eukaryotic organisms like algae and protozoans, exhibiting varied modes of nutrition's.
- **Fungi**: Non-photosynthetic organisms like mushrooms, muca and molds that decompose organic matters. 
  They have Cell walls made-up of tough complex sugar called *Chitin*. 
- **Plantae**: All multicellular and Eukaryotic with cell-wall(made of cellulode) , autotrophic plants that use chlorophyll for photosynthesis.
- **Animalia**: The largest kingdom, consisting of Eukaryotic without cell wall, multicellular, heterotrophic organisms.

## ---<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Classifications within Plantae</mark>---
⬥ Eichler (1883) classified plant kingdom as Cryptogamae and Phanerogamae.
- ( <u>don't have different body parts</u> ) -- Thallopytha
	- Algae (Chlorophyta)
- ( <u>have differentiated body parts</u> ) 
  - < without vascular tissue > --BRYOPHYTA
    - Mosses
    - Liverworts
  - < with vascular tissue >
    - ****Cryptogamae** (Non-flowering plants)**: DO NOT PRODUCE SEED
      - Pteridophyta:
        - ferns
    - **Phanerogamae** (Flowering plants): 
      - **Gymnosperms** (bear naked seeds)
      - **Angiosperms** (bear covered seeds): 
        - **Monocots** (Single cotyledon)
        - **Dicots** (Two cotyledons)

## ---<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Classifications within Animalia</mark>---
 this kingdom include organisms having cells, without cell walls as well as those which are hetrotropics, multicellular and eukaryotics 
- Animalia is split into two main subkingdoms: Invertebrate and Vertebrate.
- Invertebrates include multiple phylam such as Porifera (sponges), Cnidaria (hydras), and Arthropoda (insects). *Storer amd Usinger* classified animals into phylums given in flowchart below.
- Vertebrates are classified into classes like Pisces (fishes), Amphibia (frogs), Reptilia (lizards), Aves (birds), and Mammalia (mammals) based on various characteristics. 

**Kingdom Animalia**

- **Sub-Kingdom: Parazoa** (No true tissues)
    - Phylum: **Porifera** (Sponges)
- **Sub-Kingdom: Eumetazoa** (True tissues)
    - **Invertebrates** (Animals without a backbone)
        - **Symmetry Type: Radial Symmetry**
            - Phylum: **Cnidaria**
        - **Symmetry Type: Bilateral Symmetry**
            - **Body Cavity Type: Acoelomates** (No body cavity)
                - Phylum: **Platyhelminthes**
            - **Body Cavity Type: Pseudocoelomates** (False body cavity)
                - Phylum: **Nematoda**
            - **Body Cavity Type: Coelomates** (True body cavity)
                - **Protostomes** (Mouth develops first)
                    - Phylum: **Mollusca**
                    - Phylum: **Annelida**
                    - Phylum: **Arthropoda**
    - **Vertebrates** (Animals with a backbone)
        - **Deuterostomes** (Anus develops first)
            - Phylum: **Echinodermata**
            - Phylum: **Chordata**
                - Class: **Pisces** (Fish)
                - Class: **Amphibia** (Amphibians)
                - Class: **Reptilia** (Reptiles)
                - Class: **Aves** (Birds)
                - Class: **Mammalia** (Mammals )

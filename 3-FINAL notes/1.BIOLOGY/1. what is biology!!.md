 • "Biology" is a natural science concerned with the study of Life and living organisms, i.e., plants and animals.
• The term 'Biology' was coined by <u>*Lamarck and Treviranus*</u>. It is classified in to two part: *Botany and zoology*. Study of plants is called *Botany* and study of animals is called *Zoology*. 
• The scientist who gave his thought for the first time about the life of plants and animals was <u>*Aristotle.*</u> That's why he is known as ==the Father of Biology==. 
•He is also known as ==the Father of Zoology==. He is also known as ==the Father of  Embryology.==
• <u>*Hippocrates*</u> is referred to as ==the "Father of Medicine."==

## Q.) what is living things??
It is difficult to give a definition of life, but all living beings have some special characteristics, on the basis of that, they can be separated from non-living things. These characteristics are as follow –
1.  life cycle
2.  Protoplasm :-   
    1. [[1. what is biology!!#^60d6cc|Metabolism]] 
    2. [[1. what is biology!!#^b5d758|Growth and Movement]] 
    3. [[1. what is biology!!#^34dedb|adaptiblity and response to stimuli]]
    4. [[1. what is biology!!#^56911b|reproduction]] this is not used to determine living things.
3.  [[1. what is biology!!#^9c09c3|cell organization]]
4.  [[1. what is biology!!#^1d94e5|Respiration]] 
5.  [[1. what is biology!!#^2dd57c|Nutrition]] 
6. Excretion
##### CHARACTERISTIC OF LIVING ORGANISMS 
- They have cellular organisation and also respire, i.e., take in 02 and evolve CO2.  ^1d94e5
- Metabolic reactions, vital for processes such as respiration and digestion, are exclusive to living organisms and define them. It comprises two phases that are anabolism (constructive phase) and catabolism (destructive phase.)   ^60d6cc
- They take nutrition for their growth. Intake of food particles to provide energy and material for its life sustaining activities is called nutrition.  ^2dd57c
-  Living organisms are aware of their surroundings and respond to stimuli, indicating an awareness of environmental changes; this includes consciousness even in cases like a person in a coma, who is still considered living despite a lack of response. 
   Their survival chances are maximum. ^34dedb
-  All living organisms reproduce, but exceptions like mules (sterile hybrids) and infertile humans raise questions about reproductive capability as a defining property. 
   Therefore, reproduction cannot be considered a defining property of living organisms since not all can reproduce  ^56911b
- The life of every organism begins from a cell. It further divides to form many cells, tissues, which forms organs, organ system and finally a complete body. This phenomenon is called growth, which is the distinctive feature of an organism. They move from place to place as animals or some bacteria. Plants cannot move but some movement can occur in plants.   ^b5d758
- The presence of cellular organization is another defining characteristic, distinguishing living organisms from non-living entities;  
  organisms must possess organized cellular structures to be considered living. ^9c09c3


> After analyzing various properties, the narrative concludes that living organisms must exhibit cellular organization and respond to stimuli, while growth and reproduction are not exclusive defining properties.

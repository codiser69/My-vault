# Origin of Universe

^532802

> The universe is made up of matter and energy. Scientists believe that it was formed about 10 to 13 billion years ago as a vast, dense, red-hot and rotating gaseous cloud of cosmic dust called the  "primaeval matter or  ylem"`. 
-  Two hypothesis i.e., *Big -Bang* (universe formation through a very big explosion) and *Nebular* (universe formation by the condensation of gaseous cloud) were given to explain origin of Earth.  

## ----ORIGIN OF LIFE----- 

^7cd269

• The origin of life is called **abiogenesis**
• It appears that ==life first emerged at least 3.8 billion years ago==, because that is the age of the oldest rocks with fossil evidence of life on earth.
• ==The Earth was formed almost 4.6 billion years ago==. Some philosophical theories like special creation, spontaneous generation, Bio-genesis, panspermia (life originated in the form of pan-sperms from some unknown part of the universe) or cosmozoic and catastrophism (life originated suddenly from inorganic matter) were given to explain origin of life.
- The first scientific account of the origin of life was given by Russian scientist <u>*Al Oparin*</u> as presented '*Materialistic Theory*' in his book '*Origin of life*'. 
- The primitive atmosphere contained hydrogen(H2), methane(CH4), ammonia(NH3) and water vapour(H20) In it, Oxygen(O2) and ozone(O3) were absent.
  Thus, it was believed that life is originated  from inorganic substances by a series of complex reaction. 
- *Hydrogen* atoms were most numerous and most reactive in the primitive atmosphere. First, these combined with all available Oxygen atoms, forming water and leaving no free oxygen atoms. Thus, the primitive atmosphere was 'reducing' unlike the present 'oxidizing' atmosphere. This was also supported by <u>Miller and Urey</u> in 1953.
- In Miller-Urey experiment, a mixture of water, hydrogen, methane and ammonia was cycled through an apparatus and the organic compound, amino acids were obtained. This experiment is called Chemosynthesis.
# ---EVOLUTION---
Evolution is defined as the sequence of gradual changes from simple life forms to complex life forms, i.e., from primitive organisms that existed over million of years to new organism that exists today. it is all about changes, improvement and modification from simple life forms. Evolution is defined as Natural selection.

 - <u>*Charles Darwin*</u> (1859) give the idea of Evolution in his book "*THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES."
 - and *CONCEPT OF SURVIVAL FITTEST* was put forward by <u>*Harward Spencer.*</u>
 - <u>Ernst Mayr</u> is referred to as the Darwin of 20th century.

## ---- Organic Evolution ----
More and more creation of organism by gradual changes from low category animal to higher animal is called **organic evolution**.  
--> There are several Evidences from morphology and anatomy regarding organic evolution. On the basis of morphology (outer appearance) and anatomy (inner structure), several evidences have been described as follows:-   
##### **1. Homologous Organs** :-
- The organs which are similar in basic structure and origin but dissimilar in function are called homologous organs, e.g., wings of bat, cat's paw, front foot of horse, human's hand and wings of birds.
- These show divergent evolution.
##### **2. Analogous Organs (Homo-plastic)**
-  The organs which are similar in shape and function but dissimilar in their origin and development. e.g., wings of insects, birds and bats, eyes of octopus and mammals. 
-  They show, convergent evolution. They evolved independently, often due to similar environmental pressures or niches.
##### **3. [[Vestigial]] Organs** 
-  These are remnants of structures that had a function in early ancestors but are now reduced or useless. For instance, the human appendix is a vestigial structure that no longer serves a significant function, unlike in some herbivores.
 - Human body has been described to possess about 100 vestigial organs. Some of these are muscles of ear pinna, canine teeth and third molar teeth, body hairs, vermiform appendix, nictitating membrane of eye, caudal vertebral (coccyx or tail bone) etc.
##### **4. Atavism or Reversion** 
 - It is the sudden reappearance of some ancestral features/traits. Appearance of thick body hair, large canines, monstral face, short temporary tails, extra nipples, Extra Toes in Horses, Teeth in Chickens etc are examples of Atavism.
 - By understanding [[atavisms]], scientists gain a deeper knowledge of how genetic inheritance and evolution work, reinforcing the connections between modern organisms and their ancient relatives. 
##### **5. Comparative Embryology:** 
 - Studying the embryonic development of different species shows that embryos of many organisms exhibit similar stages in early development, suggesting a common ancestry. 
 - For example, vertebrate embryos (including humans) show gill slits and tail structures at certain stages of development.
##### **6. Fossil Record :** 
 - Fossils provide a chronological record of past life forms and their structures, allowing scientists to trace the evolutionary history of species. 
 - The transition from fish to amphibians is well-documented by fossils showing gradual changes in morphology.
 - **lead uranium method, Radiometric dating, carbon dating, fission track and electron spin resonance** is used to determine the age of fossils.

> [!NOTE]-
> - the most recently discovers link in human evolution is the discovery of fossils of '*Homo Naledi'* . it was discovered in South Africa (2015)
> - 


##### **7. Evidence from Connecting Links** 
 Connecting link, is one which exhibit characteristics of more than one groups.
 ***Intermediate Forms between Two Groups of Organisms***

 Virus is the link between living and non-living organisms.
 Tachyglossus is a connecting link between reptiles and mammals.

# THEORIES OF EVOLUTION
#### a.) Lamarckism (1809) 
- <u>Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck</u> gave the idea that an organism can pass on characteristic that it acquired during its lifetime to its offspring (also known as heritability of acquired characteristics). 
- Lamarck's theory of evolution was published in *Philosophie* *Zoologique* and had four propositions, viz as  following:-
	1. Living organisms and its parts tend to increase in size due to internal force of life. 
	2. Formation of new organs is the result of a new need and new, involvement. 
	3. Individuals lose characteristics that they do not require (or use) and develop characteristics that are useful. 
	4. Individuals inherit the traits of their ancestors. 
#### b.) Darwinism (1859) 
- Darwin's theory of evolution was *Origin of Species* by Natural Selection. 
- The theory consists of five propositions, they are:- 
	1. Enormous fertility or Abundant capacity of reproduction in animals
	2. Struggle for existence 
	3. Variation and heredity 
	4. Survival of the fittest or natural selection 
	5. Origin of species.
#### c.) Neo-Darwinism: 
- After Darwinism, neo-Darwinism emerged through the incorporation of Mendel's Genetic Principles and Darwin's theories by evolutionary scientists.   
- According to this theory, various factors affect species as mutation, nature, diversity and reproduction, and due to these effects, new species of organisms are formed.

#### d.) Mutation Theory 
 - <u>Hugo de Vries</u> proposed the theory of mutation, while working on *Oenothera lamarckiana* plant. 
 - Mutations are discontinuous variations. 
 - Mutations are due to changes in chromosomes, genes and DNA. They may or may not be inherited, Therefore a new similar species may originate from a parent or ancestral species at the same time.
#### e.) Synthetic Theory 
- Neo-Darwinism emerged as the "modern synthetic theory of evolution".
- This Theory originated from the book 'Genetics and the Origin of Species' by Dobzhansky (1937) and was named by Julian Huxley (1942)
- According to it, the five basic factors are :-
	1. Gene mutation
	2. Changes in chromosome structure and number 
	3. Genetic recombination
	4. Natural selection
	5. Reproductive isolation

`First three factors are responsible for GENETICS variability.`

## The Early Man 
- The fossils of the early humans have been found in Africa about 2.6 million years back, but there are no such evidence in India. So, it appears that india was inhabited later than Africa.
- The artefacts discovered from a Site **Bori** in Maharashtra suggest that the ==appearance of early humans== in India was around 1.4 million years ago. 
- The modem humans (*Homo sapiens*) first appeared in Africa around 2 lakh years ago and in India around 70,000 years ago.
# note :- 
- The oldest organism on Earth – Blue-green algae (cyanobacteria)
- The correct chronological order of Epochs oldest to newest  
  – **Paleocene > Eocene > Oligocene > Miocene > Pliocene > Pleistocene > Holocene**
- Latest ancestor of modern human is – Cro-Magnon man
- Archaeopteryx is – Most ancient bird of jurassic age 
  ‘Archaeopteryx’ is a connecting link between these class of animals – Reptilia and Aves
- Mammoth is the ancestor of – Elephant 
 - Dinosaurs were – Mesozoic reptiles 
   Dinosaurs were in – Mesozoic era
 - Smallest man-like ape is – Gibbon
 - To maintain population of any species what is needed :- reproduction
 - 'Darwin Finches' refer to the groups of bird.

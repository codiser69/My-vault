^c735a4

- The term '[[4. Salient features of Indian constitution#^094a2e |Secular]]' was added to the Preamble by the 42nd Amendment in 1976. 
- Indian secularism embodies the principle that **India is neither religious, irreligious, nor anti-religious**.  This ensures that the **State does not endorse or establish a specific religion** and treats all religions equally, with no preference using public funds.
- This has two implications:-
	1. every individual is free to believe in, and practice, any religion he/ she belongs to, and,
	2. State will not discriminate against any individual or group on the basis of religion. 
- The concept of secularism was already implicit in the Indian Constitution. Articles 25 to 28 of the Constitution guarantees every person the freedom of conscience and the right to profess, practice and propagate religion.

##### Justice:
The **Preamble to the Constitution** encompasses <u>three types of Justice</u>: **social**, **economic**, and **political**, which are reinforced through **Fundamental Rights** and the **Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP)**.
1. **<u>Social Justice</u>**: Ensures equal treatment for all, eliminating societal privileges and uplifting disadvantaged groups like SCs, STs, OBCs, and women. Provides equal access to education, employment, and opportunities.
2. <u>**Economic Justice**</u>: Removes wealth and income inequalities. Focuses on `equal pay for work`, `equitable resource distribution`, and `livelihood opportunities for dignity and self-reliance`.

##### Liberty: 
The idea of Liberty refers to the freedom on the activities of citizens. However, liberty does not mean freedom to do anything, and it must be exercised within the constitutional limits. 
The Preamble provides for the

Article 19 (six fundamental freedoms)  & 25-28 (Right to Freedom of Religion) is great example of Liberty.

    - **Equality of <u>Opportunity</u>**:
        - Equal chances for all individuals to access opportunities, especially in public employment.
        - Example: Article 16 (Equality in public employment), Article 39 (Equal pay, equitable distribution of wealth), Article 326 (Universal adult suffrage)
- [*] **<u>Exceptions to Equality</u>**:
	- Special provisions (e.g., *reservations*) for SCs, STs, OBCs, and women.
	- Certain privileges for *MPs, MLAs, Presidents, Governors* for constitutional functioning.
##### Fraternity: 
- **Original Meaning**: Initially, fraternity referred to a **sense of brotherhood** and mutual respect between all sections of society.
- **42nd Amendment (1976)**: The word **"integrity"** was added to the Preamble, broadening the scope of fraternity to also emphasize the **unity and integrity of India** as a nation. This addition reflects the idea that fraternity is not just about personal bonds but also about the collective strength and cohesion of the country.

## Significance of the Preamble: 
- The Preamble embodies the essence and main objectives of the entire Constitution, as intended by the Constituent Assembly.
-  As the Supreme Court has observed, the Preamble is a key to unravel the minds of the makers of the Constitution. It also embodies the ideals and aspirations of the people of India.
- While it cannot provide substantive power to the [[1. introduction#^1e5afc|three organs of the State]] nor limit their powers under the Constitution, it plays a crucial role in clarifying ambiguities.
- The ideals in the Preamble serve as the means to achieve the people's aspirations.
##### Q.) ![](https://i.imgur.com/tEm9TOy.png)
- [>] Initially, in the **<u>Berubari Union case(1960)</u>** The Supreme Court held that the Preamble was not a part of the Constitution but acknowledged its significance as an interpretative tool, stating that it neither grants powers nor imposes restrictions.
- [>] In **<u>Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973)</u>**, the Supreme Court ruled that, the **Preamble** is an integral part of the Constitution and plays a crucial role in interpreting its provisions, though it does not grant supreme power or impose restrictions.
 ![](https://i.imgur.com/0oT1pSa.png)

- **<u>Minerva Mills v. Union of India (1980)</u>** Supreme Court held that the **Preamble** can be amended through the procedure in **Article 368** of the Constitution. Any amendment must comply with the basic framework of the Constitution.
 - In the **<u>S.R. Bommai case, 1993</u>** regarding the dismissal of three Governments in MP, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, the Court stated that the **Preamble** is an integral part of the Constitution.

LIC of India (1995)</u>**, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the  **Kesavananda Bharati** decision, stating that while the **Preamble** is non-justiciable and cannot be enforced in court, it remains essential for interpreting the Constitution and understanding its spirit.
#### Enforceability of Preamble
![](https://i.imgur.com/nTiBLUX.png)![](https://i.imgur.com/4grkykt.png)


#### Why "Secular and Socialist" were not included in original Preamble? 
- **Secular**: Dr. B.R. Ambedkar felt that there was no need to include the term ‘secular’ as the entire the Constitution already embodied secular principles, ensuring non-discrimination based on religion and equal rights for all citizens.
- **Socialist:** Dr. Ambedkar also opposed the inclusion of 'socialist,' stating that it was against democratic principles to dictate the type of society in the Constitution. He emphasized that society's organization should be left for the people to decide, rather than being fixed in the Constitution. His perspective contributed to the decision to omit these two words.

#### The question arises as to why Preamble was amended? 
The Preamble was amended by the 42nd Amendment to include 'socialist', 'secular', and 'integrity' to clarify the Constitution's principles. This amendment aimed to make explicit the values that were implicitly present, adding vitality to the Constitution’s philosophy.

**Political Motive Behind the Amendment**: Prime Minister Indira Gandhi introduced these terms for political reasons during the 42nd Amendment in 1976. Constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap noted that 'socialist' signaled support for the poor, and 'secular' was aimed at minorities during the emergency period's birth control programs. 
The Constitution was already secular and socialist before these additions.

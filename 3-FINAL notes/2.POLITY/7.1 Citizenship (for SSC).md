## Citizenship: Concept 
The concept of citizenship is composed of three main elements or dimensions.
- The first is citizenship as legal status, defined by civil, political and social rights. Here, the citizen is the legal person free to act according to the law and having the right to claim the law’s protection. 
- The second considers citizens specifically as political agents, actively participating in a society’s political institutions.
- The third refers to citizenship as membership in a political community that furnishes a distinct source of identity. 
## Meaning of Citizenship 
- Citizenship is a relationship between an individual and a state to which the individual owes allegiance and in turn is entitled to its protection. 
- Citizenship implies the status of freedom with accompanying responsibilities. Citizens have certain rights, duties, and responsibilities that are denied or only partially extended to aliens and other non-citizens residing in a country. 
- In general, full political rights, including the right to vote and to hold public office, are predicated upon citizenship. The usual responsibilities of citizenship are allegiance, taxation, and military service.

## Overseas Citizens of India ([[Pasted image 20250121235437.png|OCI]]) 
The **Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI)** is a form of permanent residency that allows individuals of Indian origin to live and work in India indefinitely. Introduced by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, the OCI scheme was designed to address demands for dual citizenship from the Indian diaspora while adhering to India's constitutional prohibition against dual citizenship.
- OCI cardholders are granted multiple-entry, lifelong visas to India.
- They are allowed to live and work in India or their country of naturalization.
- They cannot vote, hold constitutional posts, or seek employment in government offices.
- Indian citizenship is granted by the Ministry of Home Affairs, but no person is a citizen of India if they have voluntarily acquired citizenship of another country.
- The Citizenship Act, amended in 2003, allows people of Indian origin from 16 specified countries (excluding Pakistan and Bangladesh) to be registered as OCIs.
- All [[Pasted image 20250121235857.png| Persons of Indian Origin]] (PIO) cardholders were deemed OCI cardholders effective 9th January 2015.

<u>**III. Parliamentary Form of Government :**</u>
- The framers of our Constitution preferred a Parliamentary system of government. Our newly christened democracy could not afford any confrontations between the [[1. introduction#^1e5afc|legislative and executive]]. This could happen only when they were separate and independent of each other.

- The Judiciary ensures the proper functioning & enforcement of the Constitution.
- The Constitution makers aimed to be unbiased. Key provisions in the Constitution that ensure the independence of the judiciary:

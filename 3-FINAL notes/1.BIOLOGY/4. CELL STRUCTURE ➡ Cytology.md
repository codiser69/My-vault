**Cytology**:- is a branch of Biology that studies cell structure, life-cycle, division, cell organelles, etc. It is studied at a micro and molecular level. 
• It is given by *Hertwing*.
# **Cell** :- 
- It is the basic structural and functional unit of all known living organisms. It is the smallest unit of life and is often called the building block of life.
- Some organisms are made up of single cell (unicellular) while, other organisms such as human are made up of billions of cell (multicellular).

# Types of Cells
These are of two types based on Cellular structure
1. **<u>Prokaryotic Cells  (prokaryotes)</u>** :- 
	- (Pro =primitive, karyos =nucleus) 
	- These are primitive cells, have no Nucleus. i.e, [[Pasted image 20241228151134.png|Bacteria]], Blue green algae
	- Instead, some prokaryotes such as bacteria have a region within the cell where the genetic material ( DNA or RNA) is freely suspended. This region is called the **nucleoid** 
	- Membrane-bound cell organelles is Absent : Nuclear Membrane, Plastid, Lysosome, Golgibody, histone protein, Mitochondria.
2. <u>**Eukaryotic Cells  (eukaryotes)**</u> :-
	- (Eu = true, karyos = nucleus) 
	- These have a well defined nucleus and membrane bound cell organelles. These are <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">present in unicellular and multicellular plant and animal cells.</mark>
	- The plasma membrane is responsible for monitoring the transport of nutrients and electrolytes in and out of the cells. It is also responsible for cell to cell communication.
	- Eukaryotic cells are generally larger and more complex

# Parts of Cell / Cell Structure  -
> All cells contain a plasma membrane and cytoplasm. Many cells also contain a cell wall. Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles, including a nucleus, while prokaryotic cells do not.
## Cytoplasm 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/yvnJrmk.png)The cytoplasm includes the **[[Pasted image 20241229090724.png|Cytosol]]** and all the [[4. CELL STRUCTURE ➡ Cytology#^2600ef|Cell organelles, except the nucleus.]]
- It is a semi-liquid jelly-like material, which joins the nucleus and the cell membrane.
  The fluid present outside the nuclear membrane is called cytoplasm and the fluid present inside the nuclear membrane is called nucleoplasm. 
- The combination of 'cytoplasm' and 'nucleoplasm' inside the cell is called [[Pasted image 20241229091141.png|protoplasm]] . It is called the physical basis of life.
- The non-living inclusions of a cell are collectively called **deutoplasm**.
### A.) Cell Wall
![](https://i.imgur.com/ORexCR6.png)
- Types of Cell walls :- [[Pasted image 20241226074213.png|click here]]
	- Primary Cell Wall
		- The primary cell, which was the first to build a cell wall, is located nearest to the interior of the cell. Because cellulose makes up the majority of it, the wall may expand to accommodate growth. 
	- Middle Lamella 
		- The middle lamella, which is also the top layer, serves as a connecting point and holds the neighboring cells together. **Pectin** makes up the majority of this stratum. However, other materials can also be discovered, including **proteins and lignin.** 
	-  Secondary Cell Wall 
		- Once the cell has fully developed, the secondary cell wall is created inside the primary cell wall membrane.  
		- **Cellulose and lignin** are components of some types of cells (particularly those found in *xylem tissues*), and they contribute extra stiffness & waterproofing. 
		- Additionally, this layer gives a cell its typical square or rectangular shape.
### B.) Cell membrane / plasma membrane 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/kJQjgOt.png)
-  Helps in regulating cell growth through the balance of endocytosis and exocytosis.
- engulfing food by Plasma membrane is Endocytosis. i.e, Amoeba.
- The membrane structure can easily be understood by the [Fluid Mosaic Model](https://testbook.com/question-answer/which-cell-theory-proved-that-the-quasi-fluid-natu--62c6e2291194668d58cbeb21#:~:text=The%20fluid%20mosaic%20model%20was,fluid%20character%20to%20the%20membranes.), which Singer and Nicolson proposed. The **Fluid Mosaic Model** is the cell theory that proved the **quasi-fluid nature of lipids** to enable the lateral movement of proteins within the bilayer
#####   movements across Cell Membrane 
- Some substances like carbon dioxide or oxygen can move across the cell membrane by a process called **diffusion**
- Diffusion is important in exchange of gases and water in the life of a cell.
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/86hi8Jr.png)
- . 
-  ![](https://i.imgur.com/JiHj2Ii.png)
	- Freshwater organisms and plant cells absorb water through osmosis, including plant roots.
- **Plasmolysis**
• When a living plant cell loses water through osmosis there is shrinkage or contraction of the contents of the cell away from the cell wall. This phenomenon is known as plasmolysis
(plasma → fluid; lysis → disintegration, decomposition). 
• Only living cells, and not dead cells, are able to absorb water by osmosis. Cell walls permit the cells of plants, fungi and bacteria to withstand very dilute { hypotonic } external media without shrinkage. 
• In such media the cells tend to lose water by osmosis. The cell shrinks, building up pressure against the cell wall.

![](https://i.imgur.com/YGuEFNb.png)
### C.) Nucleus
- A Nucleus is defined as a double-membraned organelle found in eukaryotic cell that contains the genetic material in form of DNA, which is organized into chromosomes.
- the nucleus sends signals to cells to grow, mature, divide, and die, also controlling activities like protein synthesis.
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/FAZF3xq.png)
- The cell nucleus consists of a nuclear membrane (nuclear envelope), nucleoplasm, nucleolus, and chromosomes.
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/EeGkyrh.png)
- **Nucleus Envelope** : 
	- the nuclear envelope consists of phospholipids that form a lipid bilayer. 
	- The envelope maintains the nucleus's shape and regulates molecule the flow of the molecules into and out of the nucleus through nuclear pores.
- **Nucleoplasm (karyoplasm)** is the Fluid/matrix present inside the nucleus.
- **Nucleolus** - It is a distinct, spherical structure found within the nucleus, Primarily responsible for the synthesis and assembly of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal subunits. (which are essential for protein synthesis).  
  These ribosomes are cell organelles made up of RNA and proteins; they are transported to the cytoplasm, which is then attached to the endoplasmic reticulum.  
  The ribosome is the protein-producing organelles of a cell. The nucleolus disappears when a cell undergoes division and reforms after the completion of the cell division.
- Chromatin material is also called Chromatin reticulum.
### D.) Chromosome
- Chromosomes are the condensed form of DNA.
-  The condensation is caused by special protein called **histones**. When DNA is not condensed, it is called **chromatins**. 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/EeNZLZu.png)
	- **Centromere** is the region of a chromosome where two sister chromatids attach. During cell division, chromosomes connect at the centromere before separating and moving to opposite poles of the cell.
	On the basis of position, centromere can be metacentric (present at centre), submetacentric (little away from centre), acrocentric (situated close to its end) and telocentric (terminal centromere).
	- **[[Pasted image 20241227163028.png|Telomeres]]** are the sequences of repetitive nucleotides found at the end of each chromosome. Their length shortens with each cell division, determining a cell's lifespan.
	A cell may undergo approximately 40 to 60 divisions by mitosis, as per Hayflick's limit. afterwards, it goes for the process of senescence and die.
	Cell Life is Influenced by stress, nutrition, health, and other conditions.
- Chromosomes are units of inheritance. In some viruses e.g. retrovirus, **RNA** is the genetic material.
- <u>**Types of Chromosome : -**</u>
	- **Lampbrush Chromosome** It was first discovered by Balbiani in 1882 and resemble the shape of a lamp brush.
	- **Polytene Chromosome** It was discovered by Balbiani in 1881 in salivary gland of Chironomus larvae.
### F.) Cell organells 

^2600ef

- membrane bound organelles [[Pasted image 20241229092353.png|Trick to remember]]
- present to support complex activity of Cells
- different types:- Vacuoles, Endoplasmic Reticulam, Golgi Bodies, Lysosomes, Mitochondria, Perixosomes, Ribosomes, Plastids
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/2h1vM3L.png)
- **<u>Ribosomes</u>** were discovered by *GE Palade*. These are the **site of protein synthesis**, found in Endoplasmic reticulum & mitochondria. These are minute, non-membranous particles, composed of RNA and protein. 70S type of ribosomes are found in prokaryotes, while 80S type in eukaryotes. 
- **<u>Centrosome</u>** It was discovered by T. Boveri, is a major microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in eukaryotic cells. It consists of two sets of centrioles and participate in the formation of mitotic spindle during cell division.  Centrosomes are also involved in various cellular processes, including sensory reception, locomotion, and embryonic development.

 - These are of two types: DNA and RNA. 
 - ### Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) 
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/pNH9VMX.png)
	 - *James D Watson* and *Francis Crick* who got Nobel Prize for this discovery. 
	 - It is a long polymer made from repeating units called nucleotides. 
	 - Each nucleotide consists of a nucleoside (i.e. nitrogen base and deoxyribose sugar) and a phosphate group, joined together by phosphodiester bonds.
	 - It has [[Pasted image 20241228102327.png|four bases/strands]], i.e. adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine.

- During M-stage the division of nucleus, i.e. karyokinesis takes place, which is followed by division of cytoplasm, i.e. cytokinesis. Cells that do not enter in cell cycle again gets arrested in ![](https://i.imgur.com/WAV1sdG.png) (quiescent stage).
	- **Cytoskeleton** :- ![[Pasted image 20241227212757.png]]
	- **[[Pasted image 20241227163633.png|Centrosome]]** is cell organelle takes part during cell division. It contains two cylindrical structures that are called centrioles (not present in plant cells).
	- **[[Pasted image 20241227163633.png|Centrioles]]** : Present in only animal cells, involved in the formation of cilia, flagella, and spindle fibers ([[Pasted image 20241228140807.png|microtubules]]-long stiff fiber which split cell during cell division).

- Tumour or cancer is a result of uncontrolled mitosis/cell division.
- In most plants and animals, the regeneration of lost parts and vegetative propagation in some plant species occur through Mitosis.
- **Crossing Over**  :- Exchange of genetic material occurs between chromatids (branches of chrnmosome) of a diploid set during pachytene stage of meiosis and is known as **crossing over**..

| It is preceded by S-phase in which the amount of DNA is duplicated.         | In meiosis, only meiosis-I is preceded by a S-phase.                                   |
| During prophase, there is no pairing of homologous chromosomes.             | During prophase-I, complete pairing of all homologous chromosomes take place.          |
| There is no exchange of DNA (crossing-over) between chromosomes             | There is atleast one crossing-over or DNA exchange per homologous pair of chromosomes. |
| The centromeres split during anaphase.                                      | The centromeres do separate during anaphase-II, but not during anaphase-I.             |
| The genotype of the daughter cells is identical to that of the mother cells | Meiotic products differ in their genotype from the mother cell.                        |
| After mitosis, each daughter cell has exactly same DNA strands              | After meiosis, each daughter cell has only half of the DNA strands.                    |

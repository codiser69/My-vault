KINGDOM:-
- All animals belonging to various phyla are assigned to the highest category called Kingdom. i.e., Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae and Animalia.
- Kingdom has the highest number of organisms with similar traits.
Phylum:-
- Based on the common features like presence of notochord and dorsal hollow neural system, are included in phylum Chordata 
- Classes comprising animals like fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds along with mammals constitute the next higher category called Phylum.
- In case of plants, classes with a few similar characters are assigned to a higher category called Division

Class;-
- Phylum is further divided into classes. It encompasses closely related orders. 
- Example - The order primata, consisting of monkeys, gorillas, and gibbons, is categorized within the class mammalia, alongside the order carnivora, which includes animals like tigers, cats, and dogs.

Order;-
- It represents a collection of families that share certain common characteristics.
- The similar characters are less in number as compared to  different genera included in Family.
- Examples - Plant families such as Convolvulaceae and Solanaceae are classified within the order Polymoniales primarily due to their shared floral characteristics

Family  :-
- Family includes a group of closely related genera with fewer shared similarities compared to within a genus and species.
- Families are characterized by both vegetative and reproductive features of plant species.
- Example: In the animal kingdom, the genus Panthera (which includes lions, tigers, and leopards) is grouped with the genus Felis (domestic cats) within the Felidae family.  
  In the plant kingdom, the genera Solanum, Petunia, and Datura, which have fewer similarities among them, are all placed within the Solanaceae family.

GENUS :-
- Genus comprises a group of closely related species which has more characters in common in comparison to species of other genera. 
- Genus level of classification of organisms comes between 'Family' and 'Species'
- EXAMPLE -- lions, leopards, and tigers are species within _Panthera_ genus.  
  Potatoes, tomatoes, and brinjals (eggplants) are all species within the *Solanum* genus

SPECIES :-
- They are the basic unit of classification which can interbreed with each other. 
- Species are groups of individuals sharing fundamental similarities. Distinguishing closely related species is important and often achieved through identifying distinct morphological differences. 
- For example, human beings belong to the species sapiens, which is grouped in the genus Homo.

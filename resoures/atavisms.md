It's like when an old family trait suddenly pops up after many generations of being absent. 
Atavism gives us a peek into how our ancestors might have looked and lived, showing the hidden history within our genes!   

Here's a simple way to understand it:-
Imagine your family had a tradition of having red hair, but for many generations, no one in your family had red hair anymore. Then suddenly, a baby is born with bright red hair, even though their parents and grandparents don't have it. That baby is showing an atavistic trait, a throwback to that old family characteristic.

In animals, atavism can appear as ancient features that haven't been seen in a long time. For example, some whales can be born with small, leg-like structures, reminding us that their ancestors once walked on land.

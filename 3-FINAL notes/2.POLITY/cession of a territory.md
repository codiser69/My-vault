Cession of Territory is a legal process in international law where one state peacefully transfers territorial sovereignty to another state through mutual consent
### Key characteristics include:
- Voluntary transfer of land ownership between states
-  Typically accomplished through a formal treaty 
- Can occur through various means:
	- Monetary payment (e.g., Louisiana Purchase)
	- Territory exchange
	- Post-war settlement
### Legal Implications:
- The receiving state (grantee) becomes responsible for the transferred territory
- Responsibilities include:
	- Environmental damage prevention
	- Preventing acts of violence or terrorism
	- Transferring state property, debts, and population nationality
### Modern Usage: 
Today, cession is primarily used as a technique for modifying boundaries between neighboring states, ensuring peaceful territorial transitions with explicit mutual agreement.
### Distinguishing Features:
- Differs from annexation, which involves forcible territorial seizure without consent
- Requires agreement from both states involved, including potential consent from the affected population2

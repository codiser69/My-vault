# Identity Of Aryans 

^0cf681

- The term **Aryan**, derived from the Sanskrit word ārya, literally means "of high birth."
- In the 19th century European scholars used the term Aryan to identify the Indo-European or Indo-Germanic peoples who settled throughout India, Persia (Iran), and Europe thousands of years earlier. 
misused the term "Aryan" to construct a racial identity, associating it with traits of the [Nordic race](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Nordic_race).  
that Aryans were superior to other peoples. This racial use of the term promoted a widespread, but false concept of the existence of an "Aryan race."
- They are the **1st to use Iron**, so that they can able to cut the shrubs & trees.
- They were also the authors of significant religious texts, including the *Vedic hymns*, which laid foundational elements for Hinduism and influenced Indian culture profoundly .
## Original Home of the Aryans
- The original homeland of the Aryans is controversial. The most accepted theory is that they migrated from **Central Asia and the Eurasian Steppe** between **2000-1500 BC**, eventually settling in **Eastern Afghanistan, modern Pakistan, and Punjab**.
    - **<u>Theories of Aryan Origination</u>**:
        - **Max Muller**: Aryans migrated from **Central Asia** and the Eurasian Steppe.
        - **Sir William Jones**: Europe was the homeland of Aryans.
        - **Bal Gangadhar Tilak**: Northern Arctic was the homeland of Aryans.
        - **Swami Dayananda Saraswati**: Tibet was the original home of Aryans.
- The Aryans were a linguistic group of people who spoke an Indo-European language, from which Sanskrit, Latin, Greek, and other languages later emerged.
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Note</mark>:- The **Central Asian theory** is supported by the **[[3. Aryans & The Vedic Ages (1500 - 600 BC)#Vedic Age ( 1500-600 BC)|Boghazkai Inscription (Turkey)]]**, which mentions four Vedic Gods: **Indra, Varuna, Mitra, and Nasatya**. 
## Migration and Settlement
-  Originally, Aryans seem to have lived in the **steppes stretching from Southern Russia to Central Asia**.
- A group of them migrated to **Northwest India** and came to be called **Aryans or Indo-Aryans**.
- They first settled in small groups in the **northwestern lowlands** and the **Punjab plains**, later spreading into the **Indo-Gangetic plains**.
- The Vedic civilization flourished along the **Saraswati River**.
- By the **6th century B.C.**, Aryans had conquered all of **North India**, which was known as **Aryavarta**. 
###  Economic Activities
- Aryans were primarily a **cattle-keeping tribe**.
- Apart from **cattle-rearing** and **small-scale cultivation**, they were engaged in many other economic activities, such as:
    - **Hunting**, **carpentry**, **tanning**, **weaving**, **chariot-making**, and **metal smelting**.
- The products of these activities were exchanged through **barter trade**, with **cows** being the most favored medium of exchange.
- The **priests** received cows, horses, and gold ornaments as fees for performing sacrifices.
- They were skilled at making **chariots**. 
### Sapta Sindhu – The Land of Seven Rivers
- The region where the Aryans settled is popularly known as the **land of seven rivers (Sapta Sindhu)**, comprising:
    - The **Indus River**, its five tributaries (**Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej**), and the **Saraswati River**.
# Vedic Age ( 1500-600 BC)

# Early Vedic Yug (1500-1000 BC)
![](https://i.imgur.com/qtgAEUG.png)
Sawaswati River - A mythical River
![](https://i.imgur.com/cl46bFY.png)
- Early Vedic people lived in the region of Sapta Sindhu. They had knowledge of about 40 rivers including Yamuna, Saraswati and Ganga. Ocean was mentioned as Samudra, Himalaya as Himvant, Hindu Kush as Munjavants and desert as Dhawa
- Aryan came into conflict with the indigenous inhabitants called Dasas (earlier branch of Aryan) and Dasyus (Original inhabitants). Dasyuhatya or slaughter of Dasyus is repeatedly mentioned in the Rig Veda.

> **The Dasarajna War (Battle of Ten Kings)**
> - This battle was fought on the bank of the Parushni river (Ravi). Sudas, the son of Divodas and the Bharata king of Tritsu family won over an alliance of ten tribes (Five Aryan and Five non-Aryans). 
>  - The battle broke out due to a dispute between Vashistha (priest of Bharatas) and Visvamitra (priest of alliance)![](https://i.imgur.com/aRz1o2t.png)
#### Society/Economy
- ⭐Rigvedic Aryans followed a mixed economy consisting of both agriculture and pastoralism
⭐Pastoralism was their primary occupation while agriculture was secondary.
⭐They possessed better knowledge in agriculture. Wooden ploughshare is mentioned in Rig Veda. They were acquainted ,with sowing, harvesting, threshing and knew about different seasons.
- ✨Kinship was the basis of society's structure. People gave their primary loyalty to the tribe, which was called **Jana** or **Vis**.
✨Vis was divided into grama. When grama clashed with one another, it caused the *Sangrama or war.*
✨Society was mostly Patriarchal.
✨Monogamy was prevalent.![](https://i.imgur.com/lB4SjND.png)
- Cow was the standard unit of exchange. Gold coins like *Nishka*, *Krishna* and *Satmana* were also in use. **Godhuli** was used as a measure of time and **Gavyuti** as measure of distance.
#### Polity
- The king or Rajan was the head of the tiibal polity. Although his post was hereditary, we have also some traces of election by the tribal assembly called 'Samiti'.
Several tribal or clan based assemblies existed such as the Sabha , Samiti, Vidatha and Gana.
![](https://i.imgur.com/5h77jmn.png)
The Samiti was the National Assembly of the people, while the Sabha was Council of Elders
- King was assisted by many functionaries. Most important functionary was the Purohita, the religious advisor of the king, followed by the Senani, the head of the army.
![](https://i.imgur.com/k313Zfx.png)
There was no regular or standing army. However, there were groups of infantry and charioteers.

- Weapons made of stone, wood, bone and metal were used.

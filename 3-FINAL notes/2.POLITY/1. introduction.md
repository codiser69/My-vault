**<u>Meaning of Polity</u> &  <u>Political Theory</u> :-**
Politics is an essential part of society that ==determines - what is right and beneficial for individuals and communities.== Political theory studies the ideas and policies shaping governance, It trains citizens to think logically about political issues and evaluate contemporary political developments critically.
The word polity come from **Greek** word *“polis"* which means City-states.  
# <u>State</u>:- 
State is “a community of persons permanently occupying a definite portion of territory, independent of external control, and possessing an organized government." 
we use rajya in Hindi to refer to states but it can be used to refer to a country too.

#### **Four Elements of the State:-**
1. ***Population or community of person*** : The first and most essential element for the existence of state is population. Whether the state is ancient or modern its physical existence depends on the groups of people.
2. ***Territory*** : Territory is next major element for the existence of state. A state needs a defined geographical area. A group of people without a specified territory,  cannot be considered a state. For example, Jews were not recognized as a State until they had a defined territory.
3. ***Government*** : The government is crucial for a State to function. It has three branches: Legislature (makes laws), Executive (implements laws), and Judiciary (resolves disputes). It also tries to maintains peace and order, ensures the state's unity.
4. ***Sovereignty*** : It means absolute Independence, i.e., a government which is not controlled by any other power-Internal or External. A country cannot have its own constitution without being sovereign like India.

**<u>Why Is a Political System Required?</u>**
A political system is vital for maintaining order in society. It ensures effective governance by enforcing laws, resolving disputes, and managing large populations. Modern political systems also act as welfare states, promoting freedom, equality, and justice. India faces challenges like **terrorism**, **Naxalism**, and **separatism** which demands a robust state response.

 <u>**Organs of Government**</u>
Every government faces three key challenges, for which there are respective organs that handle these responsibilities. ^1e5afc

| **Key challenges**                | **Organs/Branches of Government** |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Responsible for making laws       | **Legislature**                   |
| Implements the laws               | **Executive**                     |
| Resolves disputes as per the laws | **Judiciary**                     |

> [!Legislature -1st pillar]-
>  <u>**Historical Context**</u>
> - **Monarchies**: Kings created laws based on their will.
> -  **Theocratic Systems**: Religious texts and authorities determined laws.
> - **Democracies**: Laws are created based on the will of the people
> 
> **Modern Systems**: are **bicameral**, with two houses>
> - **India** : Lok Sabha (House of the People) and Rajya Sabha (Council of States)
> 	- The **Lok Sabha** is directly elected and plays the primary role in law-making.
> 	- The **Rajya Sabha** ensures equal representation for states, maintaining federal balance
> - **United States**: Senate and House of Representatives.
> 
> **Unitary Systems** : are Unicamerial. In this system second house is not always necessary, i.e, Britain: The United Kingdom is a Unitary state but has a bicameral parliament consisting of two houses – the House of Commons (main legislative power) and the House of Lords (exists partly to preserve traditions.)

> 	1. **Political Executive** : At the highest level, representatives are elected by the people for a fixed term, either directly or indirectly.
> 		- **Presidential executive** : In America, the people elect the head of the executive branch, i.e., the president, through an electoral college system
> 		- **Parliamentary executive** : In countries like India  and England, the executive is chosen from the legislature. The party with majority forms the government, known as the 'Cabinet'. 
> 		- **Dual executive** :  Found in France, this system splits executive powers between the President and Prime Minister. The President is elected like in the U.S., and the Prime Minister is selected like in the British or Indian systems.
> 		- **Plural executive** :  In Switzerland, the executive has equal power among its members. The seven-member executive rotates the chief position annually.
> 	1. **Parmanent Executive** :  High-ranking bureaucrats whose tenure isn't election-dependent, like IAS officers in India. They work under the political executive's direction and assist with specialized administrative tasks.  
> 	   - Includes officers from Central Services like the Indian Revenue Service (IRS).
> 	   - At the state level, there are their own public services.

>  **Powers of the Judiciary**:
 >- **Unitary Systems**: Judiciary has weaker powers (e.g., the UK). 
 >  - **[[Federalism--The Basics#^622f89 |Federal system]]**: Judiciary plays a crucial role in resolving disputes between states and the central government (e.g., the USA, India).

<u>**Different type of laws**</u> :-
1. **Positive law** :  
	- Laws created by specific groups, like the Parliament.
	- Example: In the UK, parliamentary laws are supreme.
1. **Natural law** :   
	- Based on nature and moral principles. Natural Law principles recognize basic rights provided by nature, such as the right to breathe.
	- Courts can invalidate laws violating natural principles or fundamental rights.
	- The Supreme Courts of India and USA review parliamentary laws based on this principle.
	- Example: A law restricting the right to breathe would be invalid
1. **Common law**:  
	- Based on traditions and judicial precedents.
	- Fills gaps where the constitution is silent.
	- Example: Britain heavily relies on Common Law, especially its Conservative Party.
1. **Divine law**: 
	- Derived from religious scriptures and beliefs  in theocratic governance systems.
	- Religious leaders interpret laws where scriptures are silent.
	- Example: In religious states, divine statements form the legal foundation

> <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Trivia</mark>  :- **Indian Legal System**
> - A **blend** of Positive, Natural, and Common Laws:
>     - **Positive Law**: Parliament has the power to legislate and amend the Constitution.
>     - **Natural Law**: Judicial Review empowers courts to ensure laws respect basic rights.
>     - **Common Law**: Used where parliamentary or judicial decisions are absent.
> - **Divine Laws** are not generally accepted, as India is a **secular state**. However, they apply to specific religious matters, provided they don't violate **Fundamental** or **Legal Rights**. 

<u>**Type of government systems**</u>:-  ^ac7b67
- **Based on the number of individuals in the ruling group**   :
	1. **Monarchy** (राजतंत्र) and **Dictatorship** (तानाशाही): - Governance by a single individual.
		- In monarchies, the ruler's word is law, and no law can limit their powers. A similar scenario exists in dictatorships.
		- Monarchy may turn into dictatorship, where power is exercised arbitrarily.
		- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Note:</mark> Dictatorship isn’t always controlled by one individual; it can also be held by a small group or faction.
	2. **Oligarchy** (अल्पतंत्र/गुटतंत्र): When governance is concentrated in the hands of a small group.
	3. **Democracy** (लोकतंत्र): Governance by the people. Most modern nations follow this system.
- **Based on the source of legitimacy**:
	1. **Theocracy** (धर्मतंत्र) : - Governance based on religious scriptures.
		- Example: Tibet, Vatican City.
	2. **Monarchy** (राजतंत्र)
	3. **Aristocracy** (कुलीनतंत्र/अभिजाततंत्र) : Governance by nobles or high-born individuals.
	4. **Democracy** (लोकतंत्र) : Legitimacy derived from the people
- **Based on constitutional adherence**:
	1. **Constitutionalism** (संविधानवाद)  : Governance through laws where no one is above the constitution.
	2. **Non-Constitutionalism** (गैर-संविधानवाद) : - No supremacy of the constitution; power depends on the ruler's will.
		- Example: Monarchy, dictatorship , military rule
- **Based on practical values of governance** :
	1. **Mobocracy** (भीड़तंत्र)  : Decisions made irrationally by mobs rather than by reasoned judgment.
	2. **Mediocracy** (औसततंत्र)  : Power often falls into the hands of average individuals who excel in influencing people through rhetoric rather than merit.
	3. **Plutocracy** (धनतंत्र) : Governance dominated by wealthy individuals.
	4. **Autocracy** (निरंकुशतंत्र)  : Absolute power exercised without constraints.
	5. **Meritocracy** (गुणतंत्र/योग्यतंत्र) : Power distributed based on individual abilities.
	6. **Gerontocracy** (वृद्धतंत्र) : Governance by older individuals.

<u>Another type of government systems </u>
- **Based on relatioship b/w centre and state :**
	1. **Confederal system**: A confederation is a political system where the central government is weak, and states retain independence. The former Soviet Union was a confederation, as were the initial United States states.
	2. **Federal system**: In a federal system, states agree to form a government but cannot secede. Examples include the United States, Germany, and Switzerland.
	3. **Unitary system** : The central government holds power over states or provinces. There’s no constitutional guarantee of state powers, and the central government can change state boundaries. The UK and France follow this system.
- **Based on relationship b/w the executive and the legislature** :
	1. **Parliamentary system**-The executive depends on the legislature’s majority. Examples include India and the UK.
	2. **Presidential system**-The president is elected directly, separate from the legislature. Examples include the United States.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">trivia </mark>:- **India's Governance**: India adopted the parliamentary system, finding it better suited to the country’s diverse needs.

**<u>Types of Democracy</u>** ^6f04d0
- **Based on the Relationship Between the People and Government:**
	1. **Direct Democracy**: In this system, people directly participate in decision-making. They vote on laws and policies themselves.
	2. **Indirect Democracy**: In this system, people elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf.
 - **Based on the Organization of Political Parties:**
    1. **Liberal Democracy**: A system focused on individual freedoms and civil rights, where the rule of law prevails and political freedom is prioritized.
    2. **Socialist Democracy**: A system where democracy focuses on social and economic equality, ensuring the welfare of all citizens.
- **Based on the Number of Political Parties:**
    1. **Single-Party Democracy**: A system where only one political party governs the country.
    2. **Two-Party Democracy**: A system where two political parties dominate and compete for power.
    3. **Multiple-Party Democracy**: A system where many political parties exist and compete for governance.
# **<u>Nation</u>**:-

# **<u>Constitution</u>**:-

Constitution means a document having a special legal sanctity, which sets out the framework and principal functions according to which a state is constituted or governed.

### **Need and importance of the Constitution**

- To establish Rule of Law.
- To provide a set of basic rules that allow for minimal coordination amongst members of society.
- To specify who has the power to make decisions in a society. It decides how the government will be constituted.
- To set some limits on what a government can impose on its citizens. These limits are fundamental in the sense that government may never trespass on them.
- To enable the government to fulfill the aspirations of a society and create conditions for a equitable society.

**Q.) Are Constitutions Static in Nature?**
**No**, Change is the rule of nature and Constitutions also develop through *amendments*. The Constitution is the basic document of any nation. There is a need to bring in timely changes in it because of the social, political, economic, cultural and technological changes that take place with the passage of time. The Architects of the Constitution have made provisions to make amendments in the Constitution.
